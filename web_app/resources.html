            <h2>What Are Emotions?</h2>
            <p>Emotions are your body's way of responding to the world. They are not "good" or "bad"—they are simply signals. Like the dashboard in a car, they give you important information.</p>
            <p>Feeling sad might signal you've experienced a loss. Feeling anxious might mean you're worried about an upcoming challenge. Feeling happy signals that something is going well.</p>
            <p>The first step to managing your feelings is to simply notice them without judgment. This app is built to help you do just that.</p>
        </div>

        <h1 class="main-title animated-fade-in">Meet Your Emotions</h1>

                <h2>Anxiety</h2>
                <p>Anxiety is your body's natural alarm system. It's a feeling of worry or fear about what's to come. A little bit can be helpful (it makes you study for a test!), but a lot can be overwhelming. It's often your mind trying to protect you from a future threat.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card emotion-card animated-fade-in">
                <h2>Sadness</h2>
                <p>Sadness is a normal response to loss, disappointment, or difficult situations. It's a signal that you care deeply about something or someone. Allowing yourself to feel sad is a necessary part of healing and moving forward.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card emotion-card animated-fade-in">
                <h2>Anger</h2>
                <p>Anger is often a response to feeling threatened, treated unfairly, or frustrated. It's an active, high-energy emotion. It can be a powerful signal that one of your boundaries has been crossed or that a situation is unjust.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card emotion-card animated-fade-in">
                <h2>Joy</h2>
                <p>Joy is a feeling of great pleasure and happiness. It's a signal that your needs are being met and that you are experiencing something positive. Noticing what brings you joy is just as important as noticing what brings you sadness.</p>
