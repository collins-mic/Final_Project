## 🎯 The Problem

### **The Silent Crisis**  
Mental health challenges affect **1 in 4 people globally**, yet many suffer in silence until a crisis occurs.

### **The Data Gap**  
People often feel *“overwhelmed”* or *“anxious”* but lack the vocabulary or data to identify the root causes of their emotions.

### **Accessibility Barriers**  
Existing solutions are usually:
- Expensive  
- Clinically oriented  
- Overly complex for everyday use  

---

## 💡 The Solution

MindWell serves as a **personal Emotional Dashboard**, making mental health tracking simple and meaningful:

- **Log in seconds:** Select an emoji, optionally add context tags, and save.  
- **Visualize trends:** View mood patterns over time through interactive charts.  
- **Identify triggers:** Discover which areas of life (Work, Family, School, Health) affect your mental state the most.
